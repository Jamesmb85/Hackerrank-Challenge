# This tool computes the cartesian product of input iterables.
# It is equivalent to nested for-loops.
# For example, product(A, B) returns the same as ((x,y) for x in A for y in B).

# Sample Code

# >>> from itertools import product
# >>>
# >>> print list(product([1,2,3],repeat = 2))
# [(1, 1), (1, 2), (1, 3), (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3), (3, 1), (3, 2), (3, 3)]
# >>>
# >>> print list(product([1,2,3],[3,4]))
# [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4), (3, 3), (3, 4)]
# >>>
# >>> A = [[1,2,3],[3,4,5]]
# >>> print list(product(*A))
# [(1, 3), (1, 4), (1, 5), (2, 3), (2, 4), (2, 5), (3, 3), (3, 4), (3, 5)]
# >>>
# >>> B = [[1,2,3],[3,4,5],[7,8]]
# >>> print list(product(*B))
# [(1, 3, 7), (1, 3, 8), (1, 4, 7), (1, 4, 8), (1, 5, 7), (1, 5, 8), (2, 3, 7), (2, 3, 8), (2, 4, 7), (2, 4, 8), (2, 5, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 3, 7), (3, 3, 8), (3, 4, 7), (3, 4, 8), (3, 5, 7), (3, 5, 8)]

# Task

# You are given a two lists A and B. Your task is to compute their cartesian product AxB.

# Example

# A = [1, 2]
# B = [3, 4]

# AxB = [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)]

# Note: A and B are sorted lists, and the cartesian product's tuples should be output in sorted order.

# Input Format

# The first line contains the space separated elements of list A.
# The second line contains the space separated elements of list B.

# Both lists have no duplicate integer elements.

# Constraints


# Output Format

# Output the space separated tuples of the cartesian product.

# Sample Input

 # 1 2
 # 3 4

# Sample Output

 # (1, 3) (1, 4) (2, 3) (2, 4)

# The star symbol is called a "splat" operator in python. 
# The way it works is separates each item in the tuple as individuals.
