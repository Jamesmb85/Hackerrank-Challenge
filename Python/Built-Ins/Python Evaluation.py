# The eval() expression is a very powerful built-in function of Python. It helps in evaluating an expression. 
# The expression can be a Python statement, or a code object.

# For example:

# >>> eval("9 + 5")
# 14
# >>> x = 2
# >>> eval("x + 3")
# 5

# Here, eval() can also be used to work with Python keywords or defined functions and variables. 
# These would normally be stored as strings.

# For example:

# >>> type(eval("len"))
# <type 'builtin_function_or_method'>

# Without eval()

# >>> type("len")
# <type 'str'>

# Task
# You are given an expression in a line. Read that line as a string variable, such as var, and print the result using eval(var).

# NOTE: Python2 users, please import from __future__ import print_function.

# Constraint
# Input string is less than 100 characters.

# Sample Input

# print(2 + 3)

# Sample Output

# 5

x = input()
eval(x)
