# identity

# The identity tool returns an identity array. An identity array is a square matrix with all the main diagonal elements as 1
# and the rest as 0. The default type of elements is float.

# import numpy
# print numpy.identity(3) #3 is for  dimension 3 X 3

Output
# [[ 1.  0.  0.]
 # [ 0.  1.  0.]
 # [ 0.  0.  1.]]

# eye

# The eye tool returns a 2-D array with 1's as the diagonal and 0's elsewhere. 
# The diagonal can be main, upper or lower depending on the optional parameter k. 
# A positive k is for the upper diagonal, a negative k is for the lower, and a 0 k (default) is for the main diagonal.

# import numpy
# print numpy.eye(8, 7, k = 1)    # 8 X 7 Dimensional array with first upper diagonal 1.

Output
# [[ 0.  1.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
 # [ 0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
 # [ 0.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.  0.]
 # [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  1.  0.  0.]
 # [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  1.  0.]
 # [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  1.]
 # [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]
 # [ 0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.  0.]]

# print numpy.eye(8, 7, k = -2)   # 8 X 7 Dimensional array with second lower diagonal 1.

# Task

# Your task is to print an array of size NxM with its main diagonal elements as 1's and 0's everywhere else.

# Input Format

# A single line containing the space separated values of N and .M
# N denotes the rows.

# M denotes the columns.

# Output Format

# Print the desired NxM array.

# Sample Input

# 3 3

# Sample Output

# [[ 1.  0.  0.]
 # [ 0.  1.  0.]
 # [ 0.  0.  1.]]
