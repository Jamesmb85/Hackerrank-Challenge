# A valid email address meets the following criteria:

# It's composed of a username, domain name, and extension assembled in this format: username@domain.extension

# The username starts with an English alphabetical character, and any subsequent characters consist of one or more of the following: alphanumeric characters, -,., and _.

# The domain and extension contain only English alphabetical characters.

# The extension is 1, 2, or 3 characters in length.

# Given n pairs of names and email addresses as input, print each name and email address pair 
# having a valid email address on a new line.

# Hint: Try using Email.utils() to complete this challenge. For example, this code:

# import email.utils
# print email.utils.parseaddr('DOSHI <DOSHI@hackerrank.com>')
# print email.utils.formataddr(('DOSHI', 'DOSHI@hackerrank.com'))

# produces this output:

# ('DOSHI', 'DOSHI@hackerrank.com')
# DOSHI <DOSHI@hackerrank.com>

# Input Format

# The first line contains a single integer, n, denoting the number of email address.
# Each line i of the n subsequent lines contains a name and an email address as two space-separated values following this format:

# name <user@email.com>

# Constraints
# 0<N<100

# Output Format

# Print the space-separated name and email address pairs containing valid email addresses only. Each pair must be printed on a new line in the following format:

# name <user@email.com>

# You must print each valid email address in the same order as it was received as input.

# Sample Input

# 2  
# DEXTER <dexter@hotmail.com>
# VIRUS <virus!@variable.:p>

# Sample Output

# DEXTER <dexter@hotmail.com>

# Explanation

# dexter@hotmail.com is a valid email address, so we print the name and email address pair received as input on a new line.
# virus!@variable.:p is not a valid email address because the username contains an exclamation point (!) and the extension contains a colon (:). As this email is not valid, we print nothing.

number_of_test_emails = int(input("Enter the number of test emails: "))
for values in range(number_of_test_emails):
    name, email = input().split(" ") #unpack string to variables
    match = re.match(r"^<[A-Za-z](\w|-|\.|_)+@[A-Za-z]+\.[A-Za-z]{1,3}>$", email)
	# The re.match function returns a match object on success, None on failure.
	#r"^<[A-Za-z](\w|-|\.|_)+@[A-Za-z]+\.[A-Za-z]{1,3}>$" is broken down like this:
	#<> shows where it starts and ends in the input.
	#[A-Za-z] is any upper or lower case letter
	#(\w|-|\.|_) is a group of alphanumeric characte or a dash(-) or a period(\.) or an underscore(_) The or is a bar(|)
	# The Plus symbol ( + ): It tells the computer to repeat the preceding character (or set of characters) for atleast one or more times(upto infinite).
	# So, [A-Za-z](\w|-|\.|_) is repeated until you reach the @ symbol
	# [A-Za-z]+ are a group of characters repeated 
	# \. is a period
	#The curly braces {â€¦}:It tells the computer to repeat the preceding character (or set of characters) 
	#for as many times as the value inside this bracket. So, [A-Za-z]{1,3} means a letter is repeated 1 to 3 timess
	#The dollar ( $ ) symbol It tells the computer that the match must occur at the end of the string or before \n at the end of the line or string
