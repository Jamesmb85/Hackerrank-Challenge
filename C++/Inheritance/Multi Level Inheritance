/*In this we will see what multi-level inheritance is. Suppose we have a class A which is the base class and we 
have a class B which is derived from class A and we have a class C which is derived from class B, we can access 
the functions of both class A and class B by creating an object for class C. This is called Multi-Level inheritance. 
(B inherits A and C inherits B.)*/
