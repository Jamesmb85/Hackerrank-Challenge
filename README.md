# Hackerrank-Challenge
My solution to the coding challenge on HackerRank. Multiple languages including Java, C++, Python, and SQL. 

Data Structures and Algorithms usage is also on display.

Most code is commented to display my thought process at the time.

Some code was provided with boilerplate code that handles input from the user and the purpose of the challenge was to focus on using a certain data structure, finishing an algorithm, etc.

Videos of me stepping through my solutons are found here: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCV7d5RtvrrOT6lbADekYMcQ/videos?disable_polymer=1
